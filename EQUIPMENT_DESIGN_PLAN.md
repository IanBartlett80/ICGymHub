## Zone-Based Dashboard Design

### ✅ Dashboard Landing Page (Zone View) - IMPLEMENTED
**Location:** `/dashboard/equipment`

The main equipment dashboard displays a **zone-centric view** with:

- ✅ **Zone Cards** - Each zone displays:
  - Zone name and description
  - **Overall Zone Status Badge** (color-coded) - IMPLEMENTED
    - 🟢 **NO DEFECTS DETECTED** (Green) - No active safety issues or overdue maintenance
    - 🟡 **NON-CRITICAL ISSUES** (Amber/Yellow) - Has non-critical defects, recommendations, or upcoming maintenance
    - 🟠 **REQUIRES ATTENTION** (Orange) - Has overdue maintenance or non-conformances
    - 🔴 **CRITICAL DEFECTS** (Red) - Has critical safety issues requiring immediate action
  - ✅ Equipment count in zone
  - ✅ Active safety issues count (by severity)
  - ✅ Pending maintenance tasks count
  - ⏳ QR code (click to enlarge/print) - PLANNED
  - ✅ Quick action buttons (View Equipment)

- ✅ **Zone Filter Bar** - Filter zones by:
  - Status (No Defects, Non-Critical, Requires Attention, Critical)
  - All zones

- ⏳ **Print All QR Codes** - Bulk print QR codes for all zones - PLANNED

### ✅ Zone Status Calculation Logic - IMPLEMENTED
**API Endpoint:** `/api/equipment/analytics/zone-status`

**Status calculated from BOTH:**
1. **Safety Issues** (SafetyIssue table) - Staff-reported defects
2. **Maintenance Notes** (MaintenanceLog + MaintenanceTask tables) - Scheduled/completed maintenance

**Status Priority (highest to lowest):**
1. **CRITICAL DEFECTS** (Red) - At least one of:
   - Safety issue with type "CRITICAL" and status OPEN
   - Equipment with condition "Out of Service"
   - Maintenance task marked as "HIGH" priority and overdue
   
2. **REQUIRES ATTENTION** (Orange) - Has:
   - Safety issues with type "NON_CRITICAL" and status OPEN
   - Overdue maintenance tasks (due date passed)
   - Non-conformance safety issues
   - Equipment with condition "Poor"
   - Maintenance logs indicating equipment needs repair
   
3. **NON-CRITICAL ISSUES** (Amber/Yellow) - Has:
   - Recommendations (safety issues)
   - Informational notes (safety issues)
   - Upcoming maintenance tasks (due within 7 days)
   - Equipment with condition "Fair"
   
4. **NO DEFECTS DETECTED** (Green) - Default state when:
   - No open safety issues
   - No overdue maintenance tasks
   - No upcoming maintenance due soon
   - All equipment in "Good" or "Excellent" condition

**Status Updates:**
- ✅ Recalculated automatically when queried via API
- ✅ Safety issues created/updated/resolved trigger status changes
- ✅ Maintenance tasks created/updated/completed trigger status changes
- ✅ Equipment condition changes trigger status changes
- ✅ Displayed on zone cards, zone detail pages, and in analytics
- ✅ Can filter zones by status in dashboard

### ✅ Admin Dashboard Drill-Down Workflow - IMPLEMENTED

- Bars (Uneven, Parallel, Horizontal)
- Beams
- Vault Equipment
- Rings
- Trampoline
- Floor Equipment
- Safety Equipment
- Training Aids
- Other

---

## Condition States

1. **Excellent** - Like new, no visible wear
2. **Good** - Minor wear, fully functional
3. **Fair** - Moderate wear, functional but needs attention
4. **Poor** - Significant wear, limited functionality
5. **Out of Service** - Not safe for use, needs repair or replacement

---

## Maintenance Schedule Recommendations

- **Daily Inspection Items**: Safety mats, landing areas
- **Weekly Maintenance**: Wipe down equipment, check bolts/connections
- **Monthly Inspection**: Detailed condition assessment
- **Quarterly Maintenance**: Professional inspection, deep cleaning
- **Annual Maintenance**: Comprehensive safety audit

---

## Integration Points

### With Roster System
- Display available equipment when planning rosters
- Auto-checkout equipment when class starts
- Auto-checkin when class ends

### With Zones
- Equipment assigned to specific zones
- Zone capacity considers equipment availability

### With Notifications
- Alert when equipment maintenance is due
- Notify when equipment condition changes to Poor/Out of Service

15. Maintenance cost forecasting

---

## Notes & Considerations

- **DO NOT WIPE DATABASE**: All migrations must be additive only
- Existing data in Zone, Class, and Coach tables must remain intact
- Equipment system should be optional - existing functionality must work without it
- Consider soft deletes for audit trail
- Maintenance logs should never be deleted (cascade soft delete only)
- Usage history provides valuable analytics - retain indefinitely

### QR Code System Notes
- **Public URLs**: Zone equipment URLs are public (no auth) to allow easy staff reporting
- **Security**: Use non-guessable publicIds (cuid) for zones to prevent URL enumeration
- **Rate Limiting**: Implement rate limiting on public endpoints to prevent abuse
- **Data Sanitization**: Public APIs should not expose sensitive club data

### Photo Storage Notes
- **Storage Location**: Store photos in `/public/equipment-photos/[clubId]/[issueOrTaskId]/`
- **File Naming**: Use timestamp + random string for uniqueness
- **File Size Limits**: Max 5MB per photo, max 5 photos per submission
- **Formats**: Accept JPG, PNG, HEIC, WebP
- **Compression**: Auto-compress on upload to reduce storage
- **Thumbnails**: Generate thumbnails for gallery view

### Mobile Optimization Notes
- Public forms must be mobile-first (most users will scan QR on phone)
- Large touch targets for buttons (min 44px)
- Camera integration for photo uploads
- Offline support consideration (future: save drafts locally)
- Progressive Web App (PWA) potential for installation

### Issue Type Mapping (from Fire Safety Reports)
- **Critical Defect** → Priority: CRITICAL, Status: OPEN, requires immediate attention
- **Non-critical Defect** → Priority: HIGH, can be scheduled
- **Non-conformance** → Priority: MEDIUM, informational/corrective
- **Recommendation** → Priority: LOW, improvement suggestion
- **Informational Note** → Priority: LOW, general comment

### Zone Status Color Scheme
- 🟢 **Green (NO DEFECTS DETECTED)** - #10B981 (Tailwind green-500)
  - All clear, no issues or overdue maintenance
- 🟡 **Amber/Yellow (NON-CRITICAL ISSUES)** - #F59E0B (Tailwind amber-500)
  - Minor issues or upcoming maintenance
- 🟠 **Orange (REQUIRES ATTENTION)** - #F97316 (Tailwind orange-500)
  - Overdue maintenance or non-conformances
- 🔴 **Red (CRITICAL DEFECTS)** - #EF4444 (Tailwind red-500)
  - Critical safety issues requiring immediate action

**Badge Display:**
- Use Tailwind classes: `bg-green-100 text-green-800`, `bg-amber-100 text-amber-800`, etc.
- Include icon: CheckCircleIcon (green), ExclamationTriangleIcon (amber/orange), XCircleIcon (red)
- Show status text in uppercase for emphasis
